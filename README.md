Beacon Campaign Management System

The Beacon Campaign Management system allows a service provider or commercial entity (like a retailer, a bank or a real estate agent, called Partner in this document) to manage marketing campaigns to be executed with the use of Beacon technology towards Clients. The basic idea is to push marketing offers to Clientsâ€™ smartphones when a given Client is in the proximity of a retail store, bank branch, or real estate, and to encourage the Client to engage in business activity then and there. A typical simple example is a registered Starbucks client who walks past one morning a Starbucks store and receives a marketing message with a 10% discount voucher which is valid for 30 minutes.
